# ProjectValhalla

This was the application I made for my Capstone Project, I have come a long way from where I started, but I think it is good to remember where we started. 

This is a D&D Character creator desktop app. My one regret was making it as a desktop app and not a web app. A part of this was going to be a Magical Weapon Generator. I want to complete this as a web app and I already added the Weapon Generator on [project-degenerate](https://github.com/VictorMatthews/project-degenerate). Now I will add the functionality of this app over there as well.
